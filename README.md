#Izou
A digital companion

Intro goes here

###Usage
Getting started with Izou is not that easy, but we will do our best to make it as easy as possible. To get Izou up and running, just follow the directions in the **Getting Started** section. 

####Getting Started
Izou can run on any java-enabled platform! Isn't that great?! So all you need to do is download the newest Izou release and launch the jar! We recommend that you launch the jar in its own folder, as Izou will create its own files and folders, so unless you want to trash you're desktop, listen to us! (You always should, really). And there you go, that's it! 

In order for Izou to work properly, Izou has to be up and running almost all the time. What if you want to get the most breaking news right as you enter the door, but izou is not on? Nothing will happen. To avoid such scenarios, we recommend that you run Izou as a background task (Hence the Raspberry Pi, it can always be on and there for you when you need it). There are various tutorials online at your disposal, and if you want to turn Izou into a linux daemon, [this](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/13034/executing-a-jar-file-when-raspberry-boots-up) is a great one.
