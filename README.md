Izou is a big home automation API with an added personal assistant. That means izou can play music or check the latest stock prices, control your TV, it knows when you are home etc, and eventually it will also be able to control your lights and other devices at home. 

Izou runs on apps where each app has the inate ability to communicate with other apps. That means if you develop an app that is a game, and let's say there is another app that controls your lights, you can turn the lights on and off when the user wins the game.

Further more, it is very easy to develop your own app for Izou. Just fork the [IzouAddOn repository](https://github.com/intellimate/IzouAddOn) and follow the example addOn that is included.
