#Izou

Izou is a mix between a "personal assistant" like siri that can set alarms, play music or check the latest stock prices, and a home automation system. That means it can control your TV (if you want it to), it knows when you are home etc, and eventually it will also be able to control your lights and other devices at home. 

It is an addOn based software, where these addOns have an inate ability communicate with each other. That means if you developped an addOn that is a game, and lets say there is another addOn for Izou that control your lights, you can tell that lights addOn to turn the lights on and off when the user wins the game. How that exactly is done is all taken care of by Izou.

Further more, it is very easy to develop your own app for Izou. Just clone the IzouAddOn repository and follow the example addOn that is given. More on this later.
